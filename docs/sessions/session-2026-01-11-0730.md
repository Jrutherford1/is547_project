# Work Session: 2026-01-11 07:30

## Goals
- Set up Claude Code infrastructure for ongoing project development
- Create Neo4j export capability to enable graph database analysis of committee documents
- Establish project documentation and workflow conventions

## What Happened

### Claude Code Configuration
Added Claude Code agents and commands for streamlined development workflow:

- **Custom Agents Created:**
  - `.claude/agents/feature-planner.md` - Research and plan new features with codebase analysis
  - `.claude/agents/python-coder.md` - Python development with PEP 8 standards and type hints

- **Custom Commands Created:**
  - `.claude/commands/document-session.md` - Document work sessions for provenance tracking
  - `.claude/commands/implement-improvement.md` - Implement improvements from code reviews

### Neo4j Export Pipeline
Created a new module to export document metadata to Neo4j graph database format:

- **Files Created:**
  - `data_pipeline/neo4j_export.py` - 611-line module with `Neo4jExporter` class
  - `data_pipeline/neo4j_import.py` - Additional import utilities (untracked)

- **Export Outputs Generated:**
  - `data/neo4j_export/neo4j_import.cypher` - 14.9MB Cypher script
  - `data/neo4j_export/csv/` - 10 CSV files for neo4j-admin bulk import

- **Graph Model Implemented:**
  - Node types: Document, Committee, Person, Organization, Location
  - Relationships: BELONGS_TO, MENTIONS, CO_APPEARS_WITH
  - Entity filtering to exclude generic terms from PERSON entities
  - Sample Cypher queries included for common analysis patterns

### Project Documentation
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude sensitive files
- `CLAUDE.md` created with comprehensive project documentation

## Outcomes

### Succeeded
- Claude Code configuration complete with custom agents and commands
- Neo4j export module fully implemented with both Cypher and CSV output
- Successfully exported 2,198 documents across 26 committees
- Graph includes person co-appearance relationships for network analysis
- CLAUDE.md provides comprehensive project onboarding documentation

### Files Modified
- `.claude/agents/feature-planner.md` (new)
- `.claude/agents/python-coder.md` (new)
- `.claude/commands/document-session.md` (new)
- `.claude/commands/implement-improvement.md` (new)
- `data_pipeline/neo4j_export.py` (new)
- `.gitignore` (updated)
- `CLAUDE.md` (new)
- `is547_project.ipynb` (updated)
- `knowledge_graph_explorer.html` (updated)
- `data_pipeline/build_redacted_knowlege_graph.py` (updated)

## Open Items

### Unfinished Work
- `data_pipeline/neo4j_import.py` is untracked - may need to be staged or removed
- `.env` file present but untracked (contains credentials - should remain untracked)
- Changes to `neo4j_export.py` and `is547_project.ipynb` not yet staged

### Next Steps
1. Test Neo4j import by loading into a Neo4j instance
2. Verify graph analytics queries work as documented
3. Commit remaining changes once tested
4. Consider adding documentation for Neo4j setup and usage

### Questions to Resolve
- Should `data/neo4j_export/` directory be committed or added to .gitignore?
- Is `neo4j_import.py` a required module or experimental?

## Artifacts Produced
- Claude Code configuration: `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`
- Neo4j export: `data/neo4j_export/neo4j_import.cypher`, `data/neo4j_export/csv/`
- Session documentation: `docs/sessions/session-2026-01-11-0730.md` (this file)
