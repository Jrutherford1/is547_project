    "# IS547 Project Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Project Overview</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves managing approximately 2200 digital documents originating from an internal WordPress site migration at my workplace. As previously outlined in my Dataset Profile, the data consists of PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and occasionally PowerPoint presentations already archived in our Box storage. These were curated over a decade or more by our seventy-plus library committees, albeit the majority of the data comes from 10-15 committees. The documents include meeting minutes, agendas, and related institutional records. With FAIR in mind, the curation goals I have are to enhance internal accessibility, maintain institutional memory and data provenance, and support governance through improved data organization and documentation. These documents were publicly available via our open staff site.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will adopt the role of curator or archivist, actively managing the data curation lifecycle using the Digital Curation Centre’s (DCC) Curation Lifecycle Model (Higgins, 2008). This model provides structured guidance through the stages of creation and collection, processing and organization, storage and preservation, access and use, and disposition of data within the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Tentative Deliverables</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistent naming conventions applied across all documents\n",
    "- Documentation of data governance and ethical compliance per our institutional policies; if none exist, resources from university-wide policies will be utilized\n",
    "- Metadata enhancement to improve retrieval, searchability, and discoverability\n",
    "- Documented provenance and fixity check to support institutional memory\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>High-Level Timeline</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "My high-level timeline anticipates scoping the naming and metadata enhancement portions of the project over the next few weeks, completing them by the end of March. Documentation for governance and ethical compliance will be ongoing as I work through the technical details, research and creation. Provenance documentation will occur via repository use and proper documentation with the code. Fixity goals may be adjusted based on the complexities identified during initial technical tasks of naming and working with metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Known Gaps</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Known gaps requiring further research include institutional data governance policies and application of fixity measures. I have found a couple internal resources for governance, but I may need to consult broader university-wide resources. The feasibility of manipulating document names, adding metadata, linking, or managing fixity across this volume of documents will be assessed as the project progresses. I plan to use a Jupyter notebook and Python to do the workflow for the technical documentation, code and provenance information. Governance and ethics documentation will occur via Word and exported to PDF and placed in the repo. All documentation will be accessible per WCAG 2.2 requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Anticipated Curatorial Actions</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data collection: The set is already acquired and in organized Box folders. No further action needed.\n",
    "- Ethical and legal: No explicit ethical or legal restrictions have been identified, yet further exploration of our institution’s policies is necessary to build documentation.\n",
    "- Storage: Active curation will continue via our current infrastructure, Box.\n",
    "- Quality assessment and cleaning: none anticipated.\n",
    "- Workflows will be documented and any code archived in Git so that my actions may be reproducible.\n",
    "- Provenance tracking: basic provenance information may be implemented to document changes and any curation decisions.\n",
    "- Appropriate metadata standards will be applied if enhancement is done\n",
    "- No persistent identifiers will be implemented\n",
