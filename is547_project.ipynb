    "\n",
    "This project involves managing approximately 2200 digital documents originating from an internal WordPress site migration at my workplace. As previously outlined in my Dataset Profile, the data consists of PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and occasionally PowerPoint presentations already archived in our Box storage. These were curated over a decade or more by our seventy-plus library committees, albeit the majority of the data comes from 10-15 committees. The documents include meeting minutes, agendas, and related institutional records. With FAIR in mind, the curation goals I have are to enhance internal accessibility, maintain institutional memory and data provenance, and support governance through improved data organization and documentation. These documents were publicly available via our open staff site.\n",

    "- Consistent naming conventions applied across all documents\n",
    "- Documentation of data governance and ethical compliance per our institutional policies; if none exist, resources from university-wide policies will be utilized\n",
    "- Metadata enhancement to improve retrieval, searchability, and discoverability\n",
    "- Documented provenance and fixity check to support institutional memory\n",

    "The reduction (2193 - 1610 = 583 fewer unique values) indicates that about 26.6% of the original filenames were standardized or excluded from renaming (like Related Documents), which is expected in a file organization project focused on consistent naming.  This indicates the standardization process is successfully reducing naming inconsistencies while preserving the original files in Related Documents folders that likely need their distinct names for context.\n"
